2012.02.10 repository created to keep track of various configuration files

Most of these files, and definitely the following;

    .bashrc
    .gitconfig
    .dircolors
    .emacs
    .emacs.d
    .i3 (or .i3.Dell)
    repos-list.sh

    ... will need to be soft-linked from the home directory.

I also keep (for reference) local [.bashrc] file modifications applied
in various systems, e.g. file ".bashrc_thisnode-lenovo".
