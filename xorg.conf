# Copy this file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf (http://askubuntu.com/a/4663)
# However, it appears that following a reboot the xorg.conf file is deleted from the above location
# So this solution is not really working.
# I am however leaving the file as a template.
# NB: looking at [https://vxlabs.com/2015/02/05/solving-the-ubuntu-14-04-nvidia-346-nvidia-prime-black-screen-issue/] I have tried to use:
#
#         chattr +i /etc/X11/xorg.conf
#
# ... to prevent the file from being deleted but this made matters worse and X couldn't
# start at all until I did:
#
#         sudo chattr -i /etc/X11/xorg.conf
#         sudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
#
# So the morale I guess is to not try to create an xorg.conf file anymore.
