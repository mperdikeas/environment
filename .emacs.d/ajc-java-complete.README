This emacs package was downloaded from:
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AutoJavaComplete

I did a check on 18.VIII.2012 and I confirmed that the sources I have 
are those of version 0.2.8. I did the test by downloading the following files:

https://github.com/jixiuf/ajc-java-complete/raw/0.2.8/ajc-java-complete.el
https://github.com/jixiuf/ajc-java-complete/raw/0.2.8/ajc-java-complete-config.el
https://github.com/jixiuf/ajc-java-complete/raw/0.2.8/popup.el
https://github.com/jixiuf/ajc-java-complete/raw/0.2.8/Tags.java

and diffing them with those I currently have install in the ajc-java-complete folder.
