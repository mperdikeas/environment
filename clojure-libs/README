I originally downloaded the clojure *.clj files I needed from
github one by one and kept them in what is now "clojure-manually-fetched"
(and was at the time named, simply, "clojure").
I quickly grew tired from hunting dependencies and stuff and
just cloned the entired clojure-contrib module from:

git clone https://github.com/richhickey/clojure-contrib.git

(the clone prensently lives in ~/software-deployed/)

and then copied everything from:
~/software-deployed/clojure-contrib/src/main/clojure
into the present "clojure" folder (the old "clojure" folder
being renamed "clojure-manually-fetched").

** UPDATE **
Furthermore, after some time I noticed problems with the
clojure-contrib sources I downloaded from the address above
(which I understand to correspond to the monolithic version
of the Clojure contrib library and which is not compatible
with Clojure 1.3 I am using and is only retained as a historic
artifact).
So I renamed "clojure" to "clojure-1.2-monolithic" and
cloned clojure.java.jdbc (which replaces clojure.contrib.sql)
from the proper location of the now modular contrib libraries:

git clone https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc.git

These are, at the time of this writing the present contents of
the "clojure" folder.

I also created script "synch-with-repos" to syncrhonize
with the clojure modules I download at the "~/software-deployed"
location.
